        <p> Now a days there is lot of growth and use of the computers and network systems in every field. The need of the security for the networks increasingly day by day as to save the information from the hackers and viruses. These hackers illegal activities cause economic loss, threatens national security. Security include identification, authentication for persons, authorization for network or data, surveillance cameras etc. We should develop a design of network security based on the needs of the organization. As network in the campus plays a major role of the organization because it helps for students, faculty, administration section to connect to internet and do their respective works easily. As most people use the network at the same time in the campus it should be a Metropolitan area network (MAN), the speed of the internet should be high like 100 Gigabits per sec or 1000 Gigabits per sec and mostly the network is set up using routers and bridges so there is more threat for the information.Now a days there is lot of growth and use of the computers and network systems in every field.
